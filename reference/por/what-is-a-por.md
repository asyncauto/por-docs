# What is a POR in Mr.Albert POR product?

In general, a Purchase Order is a legally standing financial document that is used to manage the purchasing of products and services from external suppliers/vendors.

In almost all scenarios, a Purchase Order must pass through an approval process before the transactions contained in it can be executed. This arrangement helps management keep a track on expenses.

In the Mr.Albert POR product, the terms Purchase Order and Purchase Order Requests are used interchangeably and both the terms refer to practically the same concept. If needed, a Purchase Order Request (POR) can be considered as the 'state' of a Purchase Order until it is approved. That is, a Purchase Order becomes a Purchase Order when it is approved and until then it remains a Purchase Order Request. As mentioned, the subtle difference between the two terms is immaterial in the context of Mr.Albert POR product.
