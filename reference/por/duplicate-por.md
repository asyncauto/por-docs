# Duplicate a POR
Using the "Duplicate" option may offer more convenience and speed in certain scenarios.

## When to Duplicate a POR

* When a POR has been rejected due to minor errors and a new POR needs to be created with only minor corrections while most of the details (Vendor, Advance %, Payment Terms etc.) need to remain the same.
* As an easier way to create PORs that share majority of the details.

## How to Duplicate a POR

1. Click on the PO Request Number of the POR you want to duplicate.
	- This can be done from wherever the clickable PO Request Number is displayed. Eg. PO Requests tab, Approvals tab etc.
<br><br />
2. Scroll to the bottom of the POR Details page to find and click the "Duplicate" button.
<br><br />
3. A new POR entry will be created containing the same details as that of the original POR that was duplicated. 

### Things to note when editing a POR

* When duplicating a POR, ensure that you edit the new POR with the required changes (changed date, line item details etc.) immediately, to avoid the potential for errors.
