# What is a Payout in Mr.Albert POR product?

Payouts are outward transactions initiated by you - the POR App user - to your vendors, suppliers, consultants etc. Every payout happens only in relation to a unique POR i.e. payouts cannot be issued without an associated POR. 

For payouts to be functional, you need to have an external payment processor account integrated with the POR App. Currently, the POR App supports RazorpayX for issuing payouts. 

When a RazorpayX account is integrated with your POR App account, you will be able to trigger/issue payouts to vendors (based on respective PORs) directly from the POR App itnerface. The particular amount will get transferred from your RazorpayX account (subject to funds availability) to the vendor's bank account with no additional steps needed from your end.
