# How to approve PORs

A L1 Approver or L2 Approver can find the list of PORs pending on them by going to
-	the "Approvals" tab and,
-	clicking the "Pending on me" link

### How to approve a POR
1. Click on the "pending" link under the "Status" column from wherever you find the particular pending POR. (This could be from the "Pending on me" table, all PORs table, filtered searches etc.)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the POR Details page to find and click the "Approve" button. 

*Note: You can optionally add comments to a POR using the "Comments" text field before clicking "Approve".*
