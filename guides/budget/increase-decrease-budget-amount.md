# Increase or decrease the amount of an existing budget

In scenarios where an existing budget's size (total amount) needs to be increased or decreased, you can edit the budget's details to make the change.

This usually happens when budget amounts are allocated in a periodic manner by finance controllers/managers.

To edit a budget's size:
1. Go to the "Budgets" tab.
2. Click on the name of the budget you want to edit.
3. Click the "Edit" button at the bottom.
4. Change the "Budget amount"
5. Click "Submit"

The budget amount will now be updated.

*Tip: For detailed information on all the editable fields of a Budget, read this reference article: [Edit a Budget](/reference/budget/edit-budget)*
