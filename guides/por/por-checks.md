# What checks are run when a POR is created or edited?

The following checks are done whenever the "Submit" button is clicked while creating a new POR or editing an existing POR.

1. Validation of mandatory fields - marked with red asterisk.
2. Whether the specified budget has adequate fund availability to accept the POR. If not, the POR will not be created and a notice will be shown.
