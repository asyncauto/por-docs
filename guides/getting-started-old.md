# Getting Started

This is a quick guide to get started with creating PORs, checking approval status and issuing payouts.

**First, some basics:**
* Each POR is linked to a Budget and a Vendor. 
* This guide assumes that the required Budgets are already setup by the Approvers/Admins and that the Vendor is not a new vendor. 

> *To learn about setting up budgets and new vendors, check these reference articles: [Create a Budget](/reference/budget/create-budget) and [Add a new Vendor](/reference/vendor/create-vendor)*

### Check status of a POR

1. In the "PO Requests" tab, all PORs will be displayed in a table.
2. The current status of a POR will be displayed in the "Status" column.
> *Tip: To view detailed status of a POR, click on the "PO Request Number" in the table and it will load the details of the particular POR. Switch to the "Approvals" sub tab on the right half of the page to see both L1 and L2 approval status.*

### Approve or Reject a POR

1. Users with Approval privileges can find pending PORs in the "Approvals" tab.
2. "Pending on me" view displays the list of PORs pending approval by the particular Approver (L1 or L2).
3. To approve (or reject) a POR, click on "pending" in the "Status" column.
4. In the POR detail page that loads, scroll to the bottom to find the "Approve" (or "Reject") button.
> *Tip: In the text field above the Approve and Reject buttons, approvers can optionally add a comment to the POR while approving or rejecting.*

### Issue a Payout

1. Open the POR detail page of the POR for which you want to issue a payout by clicking on the "PO Request Number" from anywhere in the interface, eg. from the table in "PO Requests" tab.
2. Switch to the "Payouts" tab on the right.
3. Click "Create Payout" to issue the payout. This will trigger an outward payment transaction from the organization's RazorpayX account.
> *Tip: To allow operational flexibility, it is technically possible to issue a payout even if the POR has not received either or both L1 and L2 approval. Always ensure that you are authorized to make the payout in such cases.*
