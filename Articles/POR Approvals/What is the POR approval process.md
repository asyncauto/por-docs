# What is the POR approval process?

* Each POR needs to clear two Approval steps: L1 and L2 
* Who approves the PORs?
	* L1 Approver and L2 Approver of the particular Budget
---
* When a new POR is created, an automated email is sent to the Approvers notifying them of the new POR.
* The newly created PORs will also be displayed in the list of all PORs in the "PO Requests" tab.
* Pending PORs are also displayed to the Approvers under the "Approvals" tab

---
* Approvers can 
	* approve a POR without any changes
	* approve a POR while also adding comments
	* reject a POR

~~A POR rejected by the L1 Approver will not reach pending status with the L2 Approver.~~

---
* Once a POR is approved, a Payout can be issued. 
* Payouts are triggered from within the Mr.Albert POR product, through the RazorpayX Account integrated with the Organization.
* Successful payouts will change the POR status to "paid-out? True" and will also note the UTR number and other transaction details.
